## Abstract Factory Method 🏭

The Abstract Factory Method is a creational design pattern that provides an interface for creating families of related or dependent objects without specifying their concrete classes. 🔧

## Features 🌟

- Encapsulates object creation logic 📦
- Promotes loose coupling between client code and object creation 🔗
- Supports the principle of "coding to an interface, not an implementation" 💻
- Allows easy extension to support new product families 🌱

## Scenarios to Use 🎯

- When a system should be independent of how its products are created, composed, and represented 🔄
- When a system needs to be configured with one of multiple families of products 👨‍👩‍👧‍👦
- When you want to provide a class library of products, and you want to reveal just their interfaces, not their implementations 📚
- When the lifetime and ownership of a family of products needs to be managed together 🔒

The Abstract Factory Method is particularly useful in scenarios where you need to ensure that the created products are compatible with each other, especially in complex systems with multiple product variants. 🧩
