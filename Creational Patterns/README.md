## Creational Pattern
Creational design patterns deal with object creation mechanisms, trying to create objects in a manner suitable to the situation.

The most common types of creational design patterns include Factory Method, Abstract Factory, Builder, Prototype, and Singleton.

## Builder
Purpose 
- *Encapsulates an object's construction process* along with specifying the various parts of a comlex API
- Enables flexible creation of an object that can have many different representations
- Increase code readability for complex types

Scenarios:

Objects that have complex APIs, multiple constructor options, and several different possible representations.
