# Template Method Design Pattern 🧩

The Template Method is a behavioral design pattern that defines the skeleton of an algorithm in the superclass but lets subclasses override specific steps of the algorithm without changing its structure. 🏗️

## When to Use 🤔

- When you want to let clients extend only particular steps of an algorithm, but not the whole algorithm or its structure. 🔒
- When you have several classes that contain almost identical algorithms with some minor differences. 🔄
- To avoid code duplication by moving common code into a superclass. 🚫📝
