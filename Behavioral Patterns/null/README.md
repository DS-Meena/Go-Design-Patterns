# Null Object Design Pattern 🚫

The Null Object Design Pattern is a behavioral design pattern that uses a null object to represent null. This pattern is useful for avoiding null reference exceptions and simplifying code by eliminating the need for null checks. 🛡️

Key points of the Null Object Pattern:

- Provides a default behavior for null objects 🔄
- Reduces the need for conditional statements ❌🤔
- Improves code readability and maintainability 📚🔧

## Logger Exmaple

In this example, NullLogger implements the Logger interface but does nothing when Log is called. This allows us to use it in place of a real logger without changing the code that uses the logger. 🎭

```
go run *.go
Logging:  Process completed
```

Benefits of using the Null Object Pattern in this scenario:

- Eliminates the need for null checks in the processWithLogger function 🚫✅
- Provides a way to turn off logging without modifying existing code 🔇
- Makes the code more flexible and easier to maintain 🔧🔄

Remember, the Null Object Pattern is particularly useful when you want to provide a "do nothing" or "default" behavior for an object, rather than using a null reference. 🎯
