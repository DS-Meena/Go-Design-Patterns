# State Design Pattern 🔄

The State Design Pattern is a behavioral design pattern that allows an object to alter its behavior when its internal state changes. It's as if the object changes its class. 🎭

## Scenario

This pattern is particularly useful when an object's behavior depends on its state, and it must change its behavior at runtime depending on that state. 🔀

The operations allowed in state are different.
