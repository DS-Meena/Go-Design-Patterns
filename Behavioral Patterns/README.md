# Behavioral Design Patterns

Behavioral design patterns are concerned with algorithms and the assignment of responsibilities between objects. They describe not just patterns of objects or classes but also the patterns of communication between them. Here are some key behavioral patterns:

### 1. Observer Pattern

Defines a one-to-many dependency between objects so that when one object changes state, all its dependents are notified and updated automatically.

### 2. Strategy Pattern

Defines a family of algorithms, encapsulates each one, and makes them interchangeable. It lets the algorithm vary independently from clients that use it.

### 3. Command Pattern

Encapsulates a request as an object, thereby letting you parameterize clients with different requests, queue or log requests, and support undoable operations.

### 4. State Pattern

Allows an object to alter its behavior when its internal state changes. The object will appear to change its class.

### 5. Chain of Responsibility Pattern

Passes requests along a chain of handlers. Upon receiving a request, each handler decides either to process the request or to pass it to the next handler in the chain.

These patterns help in managing algorithms, relationships and responsibilities between objects, making the system more flexible and easier to maintain.
