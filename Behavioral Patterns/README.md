## Behavioral Patterns

## Observer
Purpose:
- Provides the ability for a subject to notify a set of "observers" about changes to the subject
- Used to maintain loose coupling between elements of a system that interact with each other

Scenarios:
- Systems where state changes of a subject cannot be predicted and the list of interested "listeners" cannot be known in advance or changes during runtime
